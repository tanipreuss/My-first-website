  <!-- US Open Paragraph -->
  <p>
    The US Open is the best of the four majors because it's held right here in my home country, making it feel more personal and exciting.
    The energy in New York is unmatched, and watching the tournament live or on TV always feels electric.
    Itâ€™s a celebration of world-class tennis with a uniquely American atmosphere.
